      p I enjoy traveling, it opens my eyes to other perspectives of the world. Iâ€™m really interested in hearing perspectives about the migrant crisis in Europe right now, but I enjoy hearing different perspectives about just about anything. Outside of culture I enjoy running, hiking and binge watching Game of Thrones.
